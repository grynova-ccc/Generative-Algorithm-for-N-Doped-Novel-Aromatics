# Generative-Algorithm-for-N-Doped-Novel-Aromatics
This algorithm can be used to add heteroatoms in a combinatorial manner to PAH structures. It takes into account the symmetry of the compounds, preventing the repetition of two compounds with identical structures (canonical smiles). The algorithm optimizes the structure of generated structures using force field.
